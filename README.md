# ESP Bluepuck MOV 

The goal of this project is to build software on an ESP-32 SoC that enables the functionality to scan for an ELA Bluepuck MOV and store data transmitted through the device's advertisement packets.

## Objective 1

Create a BLE GATT Client that scans for a specific Bluepuck MOV's advertisment packets.

## Objective 2

Build functionality to allow a client to get the devices data from the transmitted packets.

## Objective 3

Store the number of motions and instantaneous motion data from the BluepuckMOV.
